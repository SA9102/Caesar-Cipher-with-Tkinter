# Caesar-Cipher-with-Tkinter
A simple Tkinter program where the user can perform a Caesar Cipher on some text they entered.
Currently, in the text input, the program only accepts characters that have an ASCII value between 32 and 126 inclusive, and so the shift entered must be between -94 and 94 inclusive.
